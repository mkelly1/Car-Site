Java Spring Boot Project.
The project simulates a simple car dealer site. It has a landing page, an inventory page and admin pages.
There are two users user:user pw:password and user:admin pw:password.
When logged in as the admin, additional administrative selections appear in the nav bar such as user list and inventory add\update.
